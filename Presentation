Galaxy Zoo 2 is a crowd­sourced galaxy morphology labeling effort that asks different questions to the human annotators and 
creates 37 different probabilities based on their response. Students will download classified galaxies from Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) 
and will cross­match the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset to the original SDSS data and download additional galaxy properties for each 
galaxy. They will then train a regression model for the 37 morphology probabilities using different parameters. How well does 
your regression model work?

To relate the work process...


1. How did your group decide which scientific project? How did your group balance the competing (but also complementary)
interest of astronomy and data science?

2. During your project effort, which componentes involved the most cooperation among the team members? Which components required
the most effort? Which components could be done through individual (not cooperative) efforts? What were the most frustating moments
and what were the most rewarding?

3. What was the scientific initial goal of the project? What was the final scientific result? Did your group change your scientific
goals along the way?

4. What limits in your knowledge or tools (software) did you reach which prevented your group from achieving your initial goals?

5. Is there more to be done on your project?
